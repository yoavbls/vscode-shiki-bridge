# vscode-shiki-bridge-advanced-example-extension

This is an advanced example extension to showcase the usage of [`vscode-shiki-bridge`](../../) and to use for developing the library.

This example showcases:
- using `shiki/core` to create a highlighter without bundled grammars or themse
- loading the current theme and all registered languages in VS Code
- displaying all the [example files](./examples/) highlighted when running the `VSCode Shiki bridge: Shiki Preview` command
